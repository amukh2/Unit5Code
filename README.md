# To-do for Lesson 1:
* Make a new constructor that takes a name as the parameter along with an intial balance and sets the instnace variables to these values
* For all constructors, assign the account number a random 8 digit number
* Make methods that allow someone to:
  * Change the account owner
  * Change/set the interest rate
* Make an ```addInterest(...)``` method that add *x*% of interest to the balance and updates the balance
